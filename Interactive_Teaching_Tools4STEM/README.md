# Interactive Tools for STEM Teaching

My idea is that STEM could benefit from extrapolating away the coding aspect of particular tasks, so as to simplify teaching.

I plan to make a web app (using Streamlit) of a basic particle physics analysis.

I will use Streamlit at first. 

Expand to Dash, or even some Python/JavaScript-based app at some point.

The idea is that data can be manipulated by relevant interactive features rather than writing code.
